As I went along in finding the means to do so, I encountered many people, some of whom I've come to regard as friends. Like Professor Foxwit-he's our resident genius; saved him from a group of man-eating plants. Jack Masque is an old hunting buddy from Amoria-almost too smooth of a talker for his own good. Lita and I are old friends from Kerning City-she's saved me a few times with that weapon of hers; so I figured she was a perfect choice for Town Sheriff. It took a bit of persuasion, but she came to believe her destiny lies here. About our resident explorer, Barricade came searching for something; he agreed to bring whatever he found to the museum. I'd heard stories about him and his brother when I was still in Kerning City. And Elpam...well, let's just say he's not from around here. At all. We've spoken before, and he seems to mean well, so I've allowed him to stay. I just realized that I've rambled quite a bit! What else would you like to know?");

I get the feeling that he's come here for another reason, as he's mentioned more than a few times that New Leaf City has an interesting role to play in the future. Maybe you can find out a bit more... " );
